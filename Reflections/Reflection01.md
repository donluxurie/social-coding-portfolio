Reflection on Activity 01.

In terms of Activity 1, I actually had a much simpler time completing it than I thought I would. It seemed daunting at first but in the end, it really was just a series of commands. Learning languages is never easy, even if it is still English, I suppose. Though this is a nice divergence from physics, I'm hoping I'll be able to pick up the subsequent lessons as easily as I did this one.
